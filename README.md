# microservices

## This is a demo application for Microservices architecture
## You have to run config service first so the other services can get their configurations from it
## then you run eureka server and proxy service
## and finally the business services; client, comptes and operations.
## NB: Edit properties to fit your environment.

# ENJOY !
